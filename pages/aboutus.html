			<p>
				Hi, I'm Katy, Mum of 4 and Creator and Director of Groovy Little Movers. 
				My passion for Dance started at school. So after taking my A levels at college, 
				I went to London to train at The Laban Centre and gain a B.A (hons) degree in Dance 
				Theatre. I worked for several years as a professional dancer, touring with companies 
				both here and abroad, before doing a P.G.C.E in Dance and Drama and qualifying as 
				a teacher. I enjoyed a variety of teaching roles, from Head of Dance in a Performing 
				Arts College, to Gifted and Talented Coordinator and Dance Consultant to Primary 
				and Secondary schools across the region. As my family grew, I moved into part 
				time teaching, alongside Freelance contracts which fitted around my family. I started 
				to build strong links with the DanceXchange and Birmingham Royal Ballet and over 
				the last 15 years, I have worked for them as a Guest Artist, Choreographer, Mentor 
				to company dancers as well as an Educational Consultant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being at home with my children in their early years was hugely important to me. 
				The more children I had, the more I realised just how significant these years are to 
				an individual's overall growth and development. As I emerged from the challenges of 
				this stage of parenting, I was searching for a fresh way to use my skill and expertise, 
				yet balance work and family.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the creation of Groovy Little Movers, I have combined my love for children and my 
				own experience as a Mum; with my skills as a Teacher and an Artist. I have created 
				classes to support your child's learning and development in these important early years, 
				whilst strengthening the parent/carer bond and encouraging communication and social 
				interaction. I hope that your experience of Groovy Little Movers will be engaging and 
				educational; as well as active and great fun.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Give your child a great start... put a big smile on your face... become a Groovy Little Mover!

				I am a freelance dance artist and teacher who works with all ages, believing that everyone can benefit from dance and movement. I began teaching after graduating from Falmouth University with First Class Honours in 2014. I love seeing how movement, singing and visual props help children to learn whilst having heaps of fun. It always puts a smile on my face when a child bursts through the door, already bouncing, whizzing and grooving!

			<p>
				I'm a 42 year old mom of 2 energetic boys under 4, which in itself is hard work, but when I was looking for classes for my eldest to attend I found Groovy Little Movers and we were hooked! Brilliant songs, energetic dancing and most of all creative, to allow any child big or small to enjoy and take as much out of the class as they feel able to. I jumped at the opportunity to come on board with a team that have the children's fun and enjoyment at the top of the priority list!
